Template mod for SanabiLauncher.
Comes with .DLLs (Windows, x64) used by mod code to use types from the engine and content assemblies.
These mods are loaded like any other RT game mod, and will be treated as a game assembly; you can define EntitySystems, Components, etc. in the csproj and they will all work fine.
